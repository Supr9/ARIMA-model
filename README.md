# Forecasting using ARIMA models



This notebook is a tutorial on ARIMA models used for forecasting in Financial Engineering.

In this notebook you will find the following:

- Explanation of AutoRegressive mdoels.
- Moving Average Models.
- Purpose of differencing in Time series datasets.
- Stationarity tests using ADF (Augmented Dickey Fuller Test).
- Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) used to determine the q (MA) and p (AR) orders.
- Barletts approximation for the confidence level of the p/acf plots.
- Train Test split to determine best parameters.




## Todo:

- Finish seasonal ARIMA models
